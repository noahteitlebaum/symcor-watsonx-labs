# 🧑‍💼 Managing AI Risk and Compliance with watsonx.governance

<img alt="AskHR" src="assets/hr_landscape.jpg">

## You need a seperate Lab environment from IBM. Please contact IBM team if you want to try it.

## 👋 Meet Jose – The Chief Risk Officer

Jose works at **TechCorp Inc.**, a large multinational enterprise using AI to improve HR processes like hiring and employee planning.

But there was a problem...  
AI was everywhere, but **nobody really knew**:
- Who built what
- Whether the models were fair
- If they followed rules like GDPR etc.
- What to do when something went wrong

Jose was responsible for managing all that risk — but he had **no clear way** to do it.

So, Jose and his team created decided to leverage **watsonx.governance** to make AI governance easy, clear, and reliable.


## 🎯 What Jose Wanted to Fix

Jose didn’t want to manage critical governance processes through spreadsheets, emails or slack messages. 

He wanted a simple system that would:

- ✅ **Track every AI model from start to finish**
- ✅ **Make sure models follow the rules (like GDPR, EU AI Act, etc.)**
- ✅ **Foster collaboration with the development team — without slowing them down**
- ✅ **Catch problems early and fix them fast**
- ✅ **Keep everything ready for audits**

And that’s where **watsonx.governance** helps.



## 👥 Who's involved in AI Governance?

AI Governance is a teams sport involving different roles in an organization. Though it's not uncommon to find scenarios where folks could perform the roles or severals personas, here's what these roles might look like:

👏 **Well Done!**
Creating structured Business Entities in OpenPages sets a strong foundation for scalable, transparent, and well-governed AI initiatives.

### Creating and defining an AI use case

#### 📌 What is a  Use Case?

A **Use Case** in IBM Governance Console is used to document and govern one or more models developed to fulfill a specific business objective. It acts as a centralized record for model development, compliance, risk tracking, and approval workflows.

> ✅ **A Use Case should be created whenever there's a business requirement that needs one or more AI/ML assets (e.g., models, prompts, or agents).**

#### 🎯 Why Create a Use Case?

Creating a Use Case helps:

* Centralize governance of related models.
* Manage risks, compliance requirements, and ownership in one place.
* Track model performance and approvals across the model lifecycle.
* Link models to Business Entities for traceability and audit readiness.

<img width="800" alt="image" src="assets/hands_on_lab_images/usecase53.png"> 


### 🛡️ Risk Review Process for Use case owner


 <img width="800" alt="image" src="assets/hands_on_lab_images/usecase18.png">
 
As a **Use Case Owner**, your responsibility is to review risks submitted as part of a  Use Case and determine the appropriate risk status. This process ensures that all risks are evaluated, documented, and aligned with your organization's governance standards.

#### 🧩 Workflow Context

This step occurs **after** a Use Case Owner:

* Creates a  Use Case, and
* Submits a Risk Identification Assessment.

You will now:

* Review the submitted risk,
* Perform assessments if necessary,
* Update the status, and
* Forward the task for stakeholder approval.


#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Task Instructions

#### 1️⃣ Risks are populated and now **Use Case Owner** can review each risk:

  
<img width="800" alt="image" src="assets/hands_on_lab_images/Model50.png">

#### 2️⃣ Review Risk Details

* Open the risk record.
 
* Review (or Fill - optional) the field values including:

  * Risk Title
  * Description
  * Risk Category
  * Potential Impact
  * Mitigation Plans (if any)
  * Inherent Risk Rating
  * Residual Risk Rating
  
<img width="800" alt="image" src="assets/hands_on_lab_images/Risk5.png">

#### 3️⃣ Decide if a Risk Assessment is Required

* In real-world scenario for each risk that is listed on the use case you would decide whether you want to assess it or not. Depending on your choice this would further invoke control assessment workflows for each risk. For the purposes of this lab only, feel free to not assess any risk and set the status to approved for all the risks. 

| If...                   | Then...                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Assessment is required  | Proceed to fill in the Risk Assessment section. |
| No assessment is needed | Move directly to setting the risk status.       |

<img width="800" alt="image" src="assets/hands_on_lab_images/Risk6.png">

#### 4️⃣ Update the Risk Status

Only for the purpose of this lab you will set the **Status** to **Approved** for each risk, In real world scenario the status could be set to one of the below values:

| **Scenario**                   | **Set Status To**     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Still under review             | `Awaiting Assessment` |
| Assessment completed           | `Awaiting Approval`   |
