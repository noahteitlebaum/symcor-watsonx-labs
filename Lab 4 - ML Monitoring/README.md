#  – Parts Demand Forecasting Governance Lab (Watson OpenScale)

## Use Case: ML Demand Forecasting Governance

## Introduction

This use case describes how a **machine learning parts demand forecasting model**, developed in collaboration with **Honda Canada**, is deployed into production and governed using **IBM Watson OpenScale**.

The solution demonstrates how IBM technologies enable:
- Scalable and repeatable demand forecasting
- Post-deployment monitoring and governance
- Institutionalization of data science knowledge beyond individual contributors

## Customer Background – Honda Canada

Honda Canada’s Data Science team was newly formed and faced challenges related to transparency, manual forecasting processes, and reliance on individual expertise.  
Through an IBM Client Engineering (CE) engagement, IBM helped Honda modernize parts demand forecasting using machine learning and establish strong data science and governance foundations.

Key outcomes:
- **39–50% improvement in forecasting accuracy**
- Forecasting for **all parts simultaneously**
- Reduced manual effort and dependency on senior individuals


For this governance lab, we use the same machine learning parts demand forecasting model developed during the original Honda PoV. The model is a supervised, tree-based regression model (LightGBM) trained on historical parts demand data, seasonality signals, and engineered time-series features.
This model was previously validated with Honda’s Data Science team and demonstrated a 39–50% reduction in forecasting error compared to legacy, manually driven forecasting methods.
In this lab, the model itself is unchanged; the focus is on demonstrating how IBM Watson OpenScale enables post-deployment monitoring, explainability, and governance of a production-ready model.

![Complete setup uploading](images/23.png)

In this step, you configure governance evaluations for a deployed time-series demand forecasting model. You see there are four types of Evaluations:

⚠️ Just Select the ones with ✅: 

⛔ Fairness (not applicable to regression time-series forecasting)

✅ **Quality**:

Monitors forecast accuracy over time using regression metrics (Pearson, Spearman, RMSE):

  **Pearson**: Captures the model trend by measuring whether peaks align with peaks and drops align with drops over time.

  **Spearman** : Captures the relative demand pattern (not exact values) by measuring whether higher-demand periods are ranked above lower-demand periods over time.

  **RMSE**: The root of the average magnitude of prediction error


✅ **Drift v2**:

For ML model in production, it detects changes in time-series input distributions and Provides early warning signals before forecast accuracy declines.

✅ **Explainability**:

Uses SHAP or LIME to explain how input features contribute to demand forecasts

![Complete setup summary](images/24.png)

![Step 32](images/39.png)

Things looks normal (green). 

The red drift indicator means the model is receiving input `Features` (in our case `PART_DEMAND` feature) that might differ from what it was trained on, causing its `Output` predictions to shift, even though all other model health metrics remain normal.



## What This Demonstrates

Using Watson OpenScale, Honda can now:
- Monitor **model performance drift**
- Track **data drift**
- Explain predictions using feature attribution
- Maintain **AI Factsheets** for compliance and audit
- Ensure continuity even when team members leave


## Summary

This lab reconnects Honda with a **previously successful ML model** and demonstrates how **IBM Watson OpenScale** enables trustworthy AI through governance, monitoring, and transparency.

The focus is not on building a new model, but on showing how **production-ready AI systems are governed responsibly at scale**.
